## Top one: No bullshit

#### Tell me about yourself
Hi, my name is April Yang, I am graduated from Dalian Polytechnic University since 2014. And work as an iOS developer for more then three years. I've spend six months to became an iOS developer when I decided to change my career. So I  think I am a quick learner.(backgroud) In my former job, I've developing an health application with my coworker, which will give health suggestion base on health data. It's similar to Medicus AI.(role)In my current company I am the only iOS developer and I collaborate with my coworker to develop two application for early education. I know the pipeline of how to develop an application from zero and how to maintained it, keep it up to date.

(And I found that Medicus AI have similar fuction to my former Application, but designed for international user and powered with AI technic, so I am very interesting in this application, and would like to take part in the development.)(Ambition)

#### Why did you quit your last job?
Actually I didn't quit my current job yet. But I think I have meet my bottleneck at my current position, if I keep working on this company my skill will improve very slowly. So if there's a chance to work for a company like Medicus AI, I will try my best to earn it.


#### Why should we hire you?
> Your value, you different, why you?

I have more then three years of iOS developing experience and I have the full skill sets that needed. Besides I have a curious mind, I will always keep my knowledge up to date. And in my former company I have developed an health application just like Medicus AI, it will give health suggestion base on the health data. I have learnt ***Deep Learning*** and ***Computer Vision*** from udacity at 2018, so I have a very clearly concept about what is AI.
After some experience of the Medicus AI, I found the UI design is very nice, but it don't support Chinese yet, so maybe I can help to make it support Chinese if I get the opportunity to join you.


#### Why do you want to work here?
> Show interest about the company

Last week I just knew Medicus AI, but now I am beginnig to love it. The UI design is very beatiful and the suggestion it given is very precise. And I have browsed the Medicus AI official website and see the video about Medicus AI at ***Youtube***. I learnt that this is an application to make people live a healthier life, and it's powered by AI, so the suggestion it given is faster then human. And I am always passionate about using new tech to make people live better. So I want to be part of the project.

#### What's your carrer aspirations?
#### Where do you see yourself in 5 year?
Don't try to be funny
Stop talking about ambition

1. bullshit, not good or wrong, nothing get, but safe
2. Review the past, talking about the future.

> Looking backward in the last five years, I can't image what I have success in the last five year. So I can not image what I will success in the next five years. 
But I am always have a curious mind, and I will be passionate about what I do. Using new technical skill to solve the problems we encounter in life is always my passion. I don't have an exactly plan in the 5 years, but I will do the right thing I can do now. I will keep improving my iOS developing skill and learn some backend skill this year. And I will challenge myself to be a team leader if there's a chance for me.


#### How much salary do you expect?
I learnt from the JD that the range is between 25k~30K, is that right?
I am not greedy, and not desperately, I will want the average of the range. That will be 27.5K. 

#### What is you greatest weakness?
list it.
weakness, and you are working on it.
1. I afraid of public speaking and my English speaking is not so good, but I am working on it. I have join the Toastmaster Club last December, I can pratice my public speaking skill and the speech is delivery with English. In addition, my girlfriend is an English teacher, so I can pratice speaking English with her everyday.

2. My major is not computer science, it's chemistry. But I do a lot of experiment at school, I think every new coding task we meet is like a experiment, we know the results we want, and then try different ways to make the right result, so I got the spirit of keep digging keep trying until I finally get the result. And I am a quick learner, I can teach myself to learn new thing when needed.

#### What's your greatest accomplishment on the job?
#### What's do you do in your current company?
In my current company I am the only iOS developer, and I build two application from zero which is Dinoread, it has an international version and a Chinese version. And I used the Swift language,and RxSwift framework, which are new to me. But after the struggle of last year, now I am very familiar with developing using swift and some Swift framework, like Alamofire, SteviaLayout. And I am responsable for the quality of the application. So I've learned a lot on how to integrated useful frameworks, how to collect bugs and how to optimalize the performance.

#### What would your coworker say about you if we asked them?
They say I am the most handsome guy in our company. Okay, this is a joke. They say I am very reliable, and very careful, because I will always finish my task before deadline and guarantee the quality.The bugs of my project is always less than the Android project. And I never late for a meeting. And I am a quick learner, I will try to do the thing I never done before, and taught myself a new skill by ask the coworker or learn from the internet.
 
#### Tell me about a difficult situation you've encountered and how you overcame it.
I used to have a strange bug, the app will freeze when some viewcontroller showed, but it happen only on simulator, the iOS device don't have the same issue. I check my code many times and try a find the solution by google, but I found nothing at first. Then I thought maybe I should learn how to detect the performance of the app, so I found a blog about "how to use the instruments?". Finally, I fix the bug by using the 'time profile' to find which part of my code expense the most time. So from this issue I learn how to use the 'time profile', and I should try different ways to solve my problem.


#### Tell us about a time when you got a difficult or unrealistic requst from someone, but they were really enthusiastic about it. How did you handle it?
Well, one day my product manager ask us to add a new feature to the application, which we both estimated it will take one month get it done. But she want it in two week. So I say "I can't promise it can be done in time, what's the main feature your want? We can do it first, and then do the other part." So we divide the new feature into several small mission, and give them deadline. Try our best to get it done. (experience) What I learn from this task is that, when we meet a problem that is too big to solve, we can divide it and give them priority level, give every mission a deadline, we can conquer it eventually.

#### What will do if someone is very difficult to work with?
I used to think one of my coworker, the backend developer is very difficult to work with, we even argue sometimes. But after one month, guess what? He became a good friend of mine. During that month, as we know each other better and better, I figured out a way how to talk with him. So given enough time and patience，I think no one is hard to work with.


#### The way you learn new things?
I will find out whether someone I knew know this thing, if yes, I will just  learn from him or get some learning advice from him. Or I will search the internet to find whether there's a video talking about the topic. If no video, I will try to read some blog or find a online course that focus on the topic.

#### Tell me about MVC?
M stand for Model, and V stand for view, C stand for Controller, in iOS that will be viewcontroller.

#### Why did you choose iOS?
I am always a fan of apple, and when I decide to be a developer. I just want to build something that can make my life better, build a useful tool. And I can share what I done with others. So I decide to be an iOS developer.

#### What is the tough decision you make recently?
I've using the RxSwift framework recently, it's a framework for reactive programming.
This framework will make coding more easy, and I am happy with that at first, but then I found the disadvantage of the framework, it will make the application take more time to launch.
So it will be painful to write my code again and remove the framework. But for a better performance I think I should remove the framework, so I will rewrite the code gradually.


#### Show up yourself, what's the best product you will introduce to others?



#### What question to ask?
Tech interview:
* I've installed the Medicus AI in my iPhone, I think the design and the user interaction is very good, it's beatiful. But after some moment of experience, I found that, it's not support Chinese yet. I know you are the Head of China, can you tell me when will the application support Chinese?

* Can you tell about the team? What kind of people I will work with if have the chance?

* What will I do if get the chance to work for Medicus AI?

* Where do you see the company in the next 5 year?
